        <p>
          After discussion with mentors, we had define five future value which
          is sustainable resources, energy efficiency and reliability,
          transparency in process and material selection, a 'bus' system
          protocol for measurement as well as eMobility
        </p>
        <p>
          Those values are defined base on the problem we are facing which is
          lack of common platform to agree and verify measurement from all the
          stakeholders
        </p>
        <p>
          By that problem, we have decided the solution will be an app that
          would provide real-time information to track the environmental
          performance of companies.
